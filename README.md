# Archived

This project is suspended for the moment, we discovered a very similar project implementing the same in `flake8`: https://github.com/pjknkda/flake8-datetimez

We'll try it out and if anything is missing, we'll try to contribute upstream and only if that doesn't work, we'll resurrect this project.
